Trading Sample with Scala and Akka.

Including performance benchmark test described in blog: http://blog.jayway.com/2010/08/10/yet-another-akka-benchmark/

=== How to run benchmark from distribution ===

Download and unzip distribution assembly: dist
The distribution assembly contains all jar files, including necessary dependencies.

In the scripts directory of the distribution there is a run_benchmark.sh script that can be used to launch tests.

Argument to the script is the junit test class or classes to run.
./run_benchmark.sh org.samples.trading.akka.AkkaPerformanceTest

There is a test suite running all benchmark tests.
./run_benchmark.sh org.samples.trading.AllBenchmarkTests

You need to define JAVA_HOME for JDK6, if you don't have it as default.

Better accuracy (running tests longer) is achieved if you change the following jvm parameter in the script:
-Dbenchmark=true

The benchmark can also be run without transaction logging by modifying the following jvm parameter in the script:
-DuseTxLogFile=false
